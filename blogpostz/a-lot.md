# a lot.

welcome to my first blog post that's hosted on my github pages blog. I want to tell you guys a lot of shit, because honestly what happened recently is just crazy.

## HTN2?? And what about Phoenamyte?
I'm currently planning on releasing Hitapo Tech News V2 somewhere else and I'm shutting down Phoenamyte. Reason? I'll explain why on the site.

## ArctineOS wen??!!!!11!!!1111!!!1!11!

## Announcing CheckAWNT
CheckAWNT is an operation I made with its purpose to basically...idk. In school, our laptops have a normal user account, a guest user and an Administrator account. 
In 5-6th grade, you always shared your laptop with someone else from your class, each of you having your own user account.
I once actually managed to find out the password for the Guest user and Administrator account, but I won't share it for privacy purposes and don't want to lose my scholarship. 
Now, in 7th grade, we got the Administrator password for the **sole** purpose of activating MS Office, setting and resetting our normal user passwords, and we could also set our own administrator passwords. 
People abused this power and installed shit ton of games and stuff. The teacher found out I installed tor browser and made a separate user account (lmao) and wiped my laptop with the newer image, that has a different and default password.
When we passed into 8th grade, we *all* had that new image with a different password. During science, since there's no surveillance software so far, me and my friend who we'll refer to as M, researched on how to change the administrator password. 
That's how CheckAWNT8 was born, a project by us two to unlock other students' laptops for them (with their consent obviously duh). It was easy for 8th graders and 7th graders, since they had no spying software installed. 
It was easy to do that stuff by the way. I just had to reboot into Advanced Options, open cmd and rename sethc.exe to etc.exe.bak and copy cmd.exe as sethc.exe in C:\Windows\System32.

Then I rebooted, on the lock screen I pressed shift 5 times to open cmd and changed the passwords. No one found anything out, many people knew that I knew how to do it though. 
Also, I got fucking snitched on. Don't know by who, but by 6 people apparently. I did it to a 9th grader, since 9th graders had surveillance software installed called Veyon, and he wanted me to uninstall it. 
So I turned off the internet, rebooted into advanced settings, did all of the shit again, uninstalled veyon and turned wifi back on and rebooted for the last time. 
Teachers found out, They apparently were able to backtrace who had it first, and even though I was the only one who did it, I actually did it to M's laptop before mine.
When I came to school today (27/02/2024), I heard the sentences "Bro the teachers found out that M had hacked the admin pass". 
I saw my other friend L talking to a teacher about his laptop, and the teacher was looking in the teacher's lounge while L is at the door. When L told me to run away, I instantly knew what happened. 
I went to my classroom, looked at the laptop shelf and noticed mine was gone. That's when I found out: "Bro I'm fucked fr". 
After french class, I was about to go into PE while talking to a friend about what happened when suddenly I heard "(name), can you come to me for a second?". 
And I thought to myself "oh well..." and just went. Now me and L the previous day made an entire plan up on what I'm supposed to say but...I'm not gonna say anything and just write our convo:
T = Teacher, M = Me

T: So, I have been told that you have been changing the Administrator account's password on students' laptops, is that right?
M: I mean, yeah, but like they wanted me to and-
T: Doesn't matter. If they would want you to rob a shop, would you do it?
M: no???
T: Interesting, we have found out that someone found out how to change an Administrator's password, and when I asked people, they all said it was you.
T: Listen, when you reset the administrator password, we can't get into the laptop to do necessary tasks, and we will have to freshly set it up. And I don't want you to do that stuff again. 
I don't care if you do it at home, but you don't do it in school, and every time you do it AGAIN, you'll have to pay 50 CHF. Besides, could you explain how exactly you did it?
M: (explains it)
T: Interesting. Well, (proceeds to tell me about the bounties hackers are given by big corporations to find an exploit in their software and comparing it to the way i did it which is punishable and against school laptop guidelines)
T: And also, we installed surveillance software on your laptop and all of the laptop that we reset so we can see what you're doing. (sorry to TiSc, LiSc, L, M, Si, JaHa, congrats to YaIm and AnAr for not being caught) 
If you're caught doing something else again, we will take your laptop and only give it to you when necessary.

(basically we ended off the conversation and stuff and yeah)

But you know what? I'm not giving up. I'm planning something with my friends, that I cannot reveal right now.

But anyway, I'm going to make CheckAWNT a batch script to run the exploit faster, and hope you guys will maybe find it useful.

I don't have much more to say, but I hope you have a great day and I want to let you guys know that some more posts are coming.

Cya!

And thanks to M for starting the CheckAWNT project in the first place.
